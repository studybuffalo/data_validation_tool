# Study Buffalo Data Validation Tool
This is a GUI tool developed to streamline data validation of the various exceptions and errors found in other Study Buffalo programs. Currently designed to review the generated data substitutions from the "Alberta Blue Cross Data Extraction Tool" and the "Health Canada Drug Benefit List Data Extraction Tool", with the possibility of extending to future projects.
